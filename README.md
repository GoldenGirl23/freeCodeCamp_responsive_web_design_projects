# Responsive Web Design Course

This repository hosts my solutions for the exercises and certification projects provided in the [Responsive Web Design Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design). 

This course covered an extensive introduction to front-end web design by helping us build functional webpages using HTML and CSS. From HTML elements and form controls, to CSS box and grid layouts, I now have a practical understanding of designing efficient and accessible webpages.
